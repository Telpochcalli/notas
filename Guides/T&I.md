# Timers and Interrupts
In this guide we will board **Timers** and **Interrupts**, what are they and how they are used.

## Timers

Timers are simple counters at some frequency, they are used to keep a record of time for different events occurring and are usually an 8-bit register (Figure (b)
that can count the number of digital pulses applied to its input, whose values start from 0 and 
goes all up to 255, and when it reaches its maximum it returns to 0 and repeats the process 
all over again, unless an interrupt is used.

- In Figure (a), each stage outputs one pulse for every two pulses which are input, 
so the output pulse frequency is half the input frequency for each stage. Therefore the timer can 
be viewed as a binary counter of frequency divider, depending on the application.


## Interrupts

Interrupts cause a break in a continuing process which are generated by an internal or external asynchronous 
event and the interrupt signal can be received at any time during the execution of the mein process. When this 
happens the processor stops, handles the interrupt and then it resumes to its normal work, this is also called 
â€˜interrupt service routine (ISR). 
- For example, when you press a key from your keyboard or move the mouse on a PC, 
an interrupt signal is sent to the processor from the keyboard interface to request that the key be read in, or 
the mouse movement transferred to the screen.
